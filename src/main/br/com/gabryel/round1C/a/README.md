# Ample Syrup

### ​[Problem](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/3274486/dashboard)

Oh, the excellence of the life of a chef in the `Infinite House of Pancakes`! In this problem, you, a chef, has to make a stack of pancakes to your clients, but no just any stack... You have to do the stack with the maximum possible amount of syrup with your already given pancakes.

### Process

No much to see here, as this one is pretty straightforward.

### ​[Solution](Solver1CA.kt)

This one is pretty straightforward. You just have to select the biggest pancakes given to you, followed by stacking them(or in my case putting them on the bottom, but details, details, the end justifies the means, not?), that already calculates the exposed area, thanks to the class StackStatus, for the applying of syrup.

I recommend looking at the solver code, it possible will make more sense than that explanation.

### For the Future?

I think I am quite satisfied with this one. Maybe make so I am really stacking the pancakes, instead of putting all pancakes at the bottom?
