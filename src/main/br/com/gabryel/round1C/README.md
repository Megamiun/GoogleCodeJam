# Round 1C

### [Ample Syrup](a/README.md)

Second Challenge I revisited after the end of Code Jam. SO. MUCH. EASIER. THAN. [PLAYING. THE. DRAGON](../round1A/c/README.md)!

There isn't much to say about that problem as it is pretty straightforward. But I can tell something about my improvement in Kotlin, after something like six months tinkering with Kotlin, it is easy to say there were improvements in my knowledge of the language, what before was clunky becomes a lot more fluent, although there is still a lot of space for improvement.
