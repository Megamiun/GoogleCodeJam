The first challenge that I revisited after the end of the code jam, possibly not the best possible choices as to do this problem efficiently is harder than it seems. 

In this challenge, efficiency is important but it is not the only problem, as it is really easy to make fake assumptions or miss simples details and even with the [analysis](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/5304486/dashboard#s=a&a=2), it is non-trivial programming it. Thanks to that(and an [IDE bug](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/oauth?state=%2Fissue%2FIDEA-176008)), I used a lot more time to solve it than I could have expected.
